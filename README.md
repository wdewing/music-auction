# Music Auction â€“ Next.js on Cloudflare

A Next.js app (App Router) prepared to run on Cloudflare (Pages/Workers) and use serverless Postgres (Neon).

## Quick start

1) Install dependencies

```
npm install
# or: pnpm install / yarn install
```

2) Configure environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `DATABASE_URL` to your Neon connection string.

3) Run locally

```
npm run dev
```

- Health check: GET http://localhost:3000/api/health
- DB health (requires `DATABASE_URL`): GET http://localhost:3000/api/db-health

## Cloudflare (Next on Pages)

This repo includes scripts to build for Cloudflare Pages using the official adapter.

- Build + adapt output for Pages:

```
npm run cf:build
```

This produces `.vercel/output/**` and adapts it for Pages Functions.

- Preview locally with Wrangler (simulates Pages):

```
npm run cf:preview
```

Notes:
- Ensure `wrangler` is installed via devDependencies (already in package.json).
- If your project runs into Node API needs, `compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]` is set in `wrangler.toml`.

## Database (Neon)

- This app uses `@neondatabase/serverless` for an edge-compatible Postgres client.
- See `lib/db.ts` for a minimal setup and `app/api/db-health/route.ts` for an example query.

## Next steps

- Add auth (e.g., Clerk/Auth.js) suitable for edge.
- Model auction items, bids, and users; then wire CRUD routes.
- Add UI for listing items and placing bids.
- Set up CI and Cloudflare Pages deployment.
